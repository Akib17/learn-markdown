Why Use It?
It’s Easy to Learn and Fast to Use
Markdown is dead simple to learn. The official syntax can be found here, but most of what you’ll need to know is that typing *word* will make it bold, typing **word** or _word_ will italicize the word, links are written like this [anchor text](http://www.URL.com), and lists are written exactly how you’d expect: just hit enter and add any of these three characters at the start of each line: -, *, +. So this:

- List item 1

- List item 2

- List item 3

Becomes this:

List item 1
List item 2
List item 3
Or you could always use a tutorial to learn how to write Markdown, like this one.

So typing Markdown is almost always faster than writing with a rich text editor, especially when you start getting into things like links or bulleted lists, which either make you use the mouse or force you to memorize a complicated sequence of keyboard shortcuts. One caveat is that if you need complicated text elements, such as tables, you’re better off sticking to HTML. Fortunately, Markdown has full HTML support, so you can code a table in HTML and go right back to Markdown in the same document.

Plus, it’s much easier to read raw Markdown than it is to read raw HTML. Which, you know, was part of the reason Markdown was even invented.
